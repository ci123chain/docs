# Governance

WeeLink governance makes sure that everything works seamlessly. It is important to make sure that the system can function efficiently while still in active development by developers all around the world. The WeeLink introduces some community governance systems to provide users with more say on how the network develops. WLK holders can submit proposals for improving governance or other vital upgrades. These proposals are then put to a vote, with WLK users making the final approval decision. Community governance mechanisms serve an important role in keeping a project’s community involved and cohesive.

The Governance Powers in the WeeLink system are divided and carefully checked and balanced within three major governing structures. They are the WeeLink General Assembly and affiliated organizations, WeeLink Dao and WeeLink Foundation.



## The WeeLink General Assembly

The main parts under this category are:&#x20;

* The General Assembly&#x20;
* The Security and Trusteeship Council&#x20;
* The Collaborative Commerce (“CoComm”) Council&#x20;
* The Secretariat&#x20;
* Specialized Agencies. The specialized agencies are autonomous international organizations working with the WeeLink. All were brought into relationship with the WeeLink through negotiated agreements.

### General Assembly

The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the WeeLink. All Member Public Cloud Nodes (“PCNs”) of the WeeLink are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only WeeLink body with universal representation. Each Member shall have only one representative in the General Assembly and each member of the General Assembly shall have one vote.

The General Assembly may consider the general principles of co-operation in the maintenance of WeeLink System integrity and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments, and may make recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council or to both.

The General Assembly may discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of WeeLink System integrity and security brought before it by any Member PCN, or by the Security and Trusteeship Council, or by other WeeLink node which is not a Member of the General assembly, and may make recommendations with regard to any such questions to the node or nodes concerned or to the Security and Trusteeship Council or to both. Any such questions on which action is necessary shall be referred to the Security and Trusteeship Council by the General Assembly either before or after discussion. The General Assembly may call the attention of the Security and Trusteeship Council to situations which are likely to endanger WeeLink System integrity and security.

While the Security and Trusteeship Council is exercising in respect to any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests. The Secretary-General, with the consent of the Security and Trusteeship Council, shall notify the General Assembly at each session of any matters relative to the maintenance of WeeLink System integrity and security which are being dealt with by the Security and Trusteeship Council and shall similarly notify the General Assembly, or the Members of the General Assembly immediately the Security Council ceases to deal with such matters.

The General Assembly shall initiate studies and make recommendations for the purpose of promoting international cooperation in the technical, economic, social, cultural, educational, and health fields.

### The Security and Trusteeship Council

The Security and Trusteeship Council has primary responsibility, under the WeeLink Charter, for the maintenance and supervision of PCNs’ service integrity and security. It has 21 Members (5 permanent and 16 non-permanent members). Each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member PCNs are obligated to comply with Council decisions.&#x20;

The non-permanent members of the Security and Trusteeship Council shall be elected for a term of two years. In the first election of the non-permanent members after the increase of the membership of the Security Council from eleven to fifteen, two of the four additional members shall be chosen for a term of one year. A retiring member shall not be eligible for immediate re-election. Each member of the Security and Trusteeship Council shall have one representative.&#x20;

In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the General Assembly, its Members confer on the Security and Trusteeship Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of WeeLink System integrity and security, and agree that, in carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the Security and Trusteeship Council acts on their behalf. In discharging these duties, the Security and Trusteeship Council shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the General Assembly, and the specific powers are granted to the Security and Trusteeship Council for the discharge of these duties.&#x20;

The Security Council shall submit annual and, when necessary, special reports to the General Assembly for its consideration.&#x20;

Each member of the Security Council shall have one vote. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of 12 members.&#x20;

Decisions of the Security and Trusteeship Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of 12 members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting.&#x20;

The Security and Trusteeship Council shall be so organized as to be able to function continuously. Each member of the Security Council shall for this purpose be represented at all times at the seat of the Organization and hold periodic meetings.&#x20;

Any Member of the General Assembly which is not a member of the Security Council may participate, without vote, in the discussion of any question brought before the Security and Trusteeship Council whenever the latter considers that the interests of that Member are specially affected. Any Member of the General Assembly which is not a member of the Security and Trusteeship Council or any PCN which is not a Member of the General Assembly, if it is a party to a dispute under consideration by the Security and Trusteeship Council, shall be invited to participate, without vote, in the discussion relating to the dispute. The Security and Trusteeship Council shall lay down such conditions as it deems just for the participation of a state which is not a Member of the General Assembly.



### The Collaborative Commerce Council

The Collaborative Commerce Council deals with the global rules of trade between member PCNs. Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible. Resolving trade disputes is one of the core activities of the Collaborative Commerce Council. A dispute arises when a member PCN believes another member PCN is violating an agreement or a commitment that it has made with the Collaborative Commerce Council. The Collaborative Commerce Council has one active international dispute settlement mechanism in the world.&#x20;

The Collaborative Commerce Council convenes as the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) to deal with disputes between WTO members. Such disputes may arise with respect to any agreement contained in the Final Act of the WeeLink Collaborative Commerce that is subject to the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). The DSB has authority to establish dispute settlement panels, refer matters to arbitration, adopt panel, Appellate Body and arbitration reports, maintain surveillance over the implementation of recommendations and rulings contained in such reports, and authorize suspension of concessions in the event of non-compliance with those recommendations and rulings.

### The Regional Committee

The General Assembly may set up a Regional Committee. The Regional Committee meets to formulate policies, provide oversight for regional programs, hear progress reports, and consider, revise and endorse new initiatives. It adopts resolutions and makes decisions that guide the work of the Regional PCNs.



## WeeLink Dao

The WeeLink Executive Committee oversees the WeeLink Blockchain governance process. The Committee is an on-chain collective that exists to represent passive stakeholders. It does this by proposing important changes and canceling uncontroversial dangerous proposals. Any WLK token holder can run for membership in the Committee, but their reputation is at stake to act in good faith for the network. The first directors of the WeeLink Executive Committee will be comprised of 7 seats, of which 3 seats will be nominated by the WeeLink Foundation and 4 seats will be elected via onchain public voting within the community.

The numbers of nominations from the WeeLink Foundation are reduced by at least one seat every two years. After 6 years, the WeeLink Foundation can no longer nominate seats.

WeeLink will launch with a Council with 13 seats and gradually expand to 23. Committee elections use an approval voting scheme where users can vote for any number of candidates that they support. The election uses the same Phragmen process as validator selection to choose councillors by selecting the most-backed configuration. Phragmen is an approval voting method where users select all acceptable candidates and the vote counting algorithm finds the set of commissaries that have the most cumulative backing, thus forming the most acceptable Committee.

The Committee election also accounts for the order that users vote for councillors by scoring them based on how many they are ranked ahead of. The commissary with the highest score is the prime councillor; if the prime votes aye, then that applies to all abstainers at the end of a Committee voting period.

A commissary can propose to send a proposal to the governance system. In this example, a commissary proposed a new validator count. If enough commissary vote to approve it, then it will eventually have a public referendum.

The WeeLink ecosystem has a set of parameters available that are subject of WLK Holder approval. Initially, WeeLink has the following blockchain parameters:

* [x] Fee structure: fees that have to be paid by customers for individual transactions&#x20;
* [x] Block interval: i.e. block interval, max size of block/transaction&#x20;
* [x] Expiration parameters: i.e. maximum expiration interval&#x20;
* [x] Witness parameters: i.e. maximum amount of witnesses (block producers)&#x20;
* [x] Committee parameters: i.e. maximum amount of committee members&#x20;
* [x] Witness pay: payment for each witness per signed block&#x20;
* [x] Worker budget: available budget available for budget items (e.g. development)

Please note that the given set of parameters serves as an example and that the network’s parameters are subject to change over time.&#x20;

In addition to defining the parameters, any active witness can propose a protocol or business upgrade (i.e. hard fork) which can be voted on (or against) by WLK Holders.

## WeeLink Foundation

The WeeLink Foundation provides grants, service agreements, part-time or full-time employment and investments. We help support both on- and off-chain projects enriching WeeVerse. The main parts of the Foundation are the Foundation Council, the Advisory Committee, the Technical Committee, the Application Committee, the Research Department and the Secretariat.

### The Foundation Council

The Foundation Council oversees the mission and vision of the WeeLink Foundation and ensures the activities of the WF are aligned with promoting and advancing research and development in open and decentralized or distributed networks, with a particular focus on the WeeLink Network. WF is also responsible for day to day WF operations in collaboration with the funded teams to ensure the mission and vision are embodied in all these company activities.

The Technical Committee

The Technical Committee serves as WeeLink’s last line of defense against software errors. Unlike the Executive Council, 56 the Technical Committee is not elected by vote, but rather selected by the Foundation based on having provided a formal specification or client implementation of the WeeLink protocol.&#x20;

The Technical Committee cannot make proposals, but rather can fast-track existing proposals to make them happen in a shorter time frame than normal. If unanimous, then the Technical Committee can skip the enactment delay (more on that later) and enact the proposal as soon as it passes.&#x20;

Although the Technical Committee is not elected, they have a limited scope, and the proposals that they fast track still need to go through a public referendum. They can only make governance for critical bug fixes happen faster than normal, but cannot control the network.

### The Application Committee

Engineering turns research into software; product turns software into user-experiences. The committee invests in powerful teams at the “angelic” moment, which can design and develop distributed internet services and decentralized financial systems over the long term. The fund is managed by the Application Committee with additional support from other affiliated Funds.&#x20;

Teams invested by the Committee will be screened according to the following criteria:

* Experienced team&#x20;
* Take care of the user experience&#x20;
* Plan to develop and fix network effect problems&#x20;
* Develop Internet neutrality&#x20;
* The team has a deep understanding of decentralized finance&#x20;
* Tokenization team of governance

### The Research Department

Advancing basic and applied research in cryptography, distributed systems, formal verification, and mechanism design. We are primarily interested in general purpose technologies that expand the environment, capabilities, and security of the WeeLink ecosystem.

### Work with the Foundation

A blockchain parameter (defined by WLK Holders through the committee) defines the daily available budget. No more than that can be paid at any time to all workers combined.&#x20;

The daily budget is distributed as follows:

* [x] The available budget is taken out of reserves pool.&#x20;
* [x] The budget items are sorted according to their approval rate (Pro/Con) in a descending order.&#x20;
* [x] Starting at the worker with the highest approval rate, the requested daily pay is paid until the daily budget is depleted.&#x20;
* [x] The worker with the lowest approval rate that was paid may receive less than the requested pay&#x20;
* [x] Hence, in order to be successfully funded by the WeeLink ecosystem, the WLK Holders approval for your budget item needs to be highly ranked.

Since the payments for workers from the non-liquid reserve pool result in an increased supply of BTS, these payments are vesting over a period of time defined by WLK Holders.
