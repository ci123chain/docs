# Introduction

## Weelink

Weelink is a public distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. You can use Weelink's network services–Consensus, Tokens, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the hashgraph consensus algorithm, to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.

WeeLink created WeeVerse, a close replica of the "Real World". Even the Real World is not flat and not homogeneous. We normalized the basic element of WeeVerse to Virtual Organization (called "Vorg") whether it refers to a single member, a group of people or a Real Organization that has filed to operate as a single entity. Assets of a Vorg in the WeeVerse are normalized to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where graph nodes denote both the on-chain and off-chain applications (including Smart Contracts) and data they can access (see Fig.1). With the combination of both the on-chain and off-chain Authentication and Authorization systems, you determine which Vorg and applications can access your Graph Node, and grant or revoke access to any slice of your function and data as needed. Any activity of Business or Customers in the WeeVerse is normalized to the access of one or a set of DAG nodes. Further, the orange dash dot line in Figure.1 illustrates a typical use case that helps explain how the WEELink system could accomplish collaborative Commerce between Vorgs.

## Elementary Components



WeeLink is a public blockchain network, where

* Many independent homogeneous blockchains called "subchains" are managed by relay blockchains called "relaychains".
* This multi-chain operating system also provides compatibility with one or more pre-existing networks, such as Ethereum, Comos and BSC.
* Subchains are distributed internet computers composed of light nodes (on-chain processor and light ledger storage),full nodes (on-chain processor and full ledger storage) and cloud nodes (on-chain processors complemented by offchain coprocessors).&#x20;
* Off-chain coprocessors work with on-node "business peripherals" to facilitate development, deployment and collaborative commerce ("CoComm") between limitless B2B, B2C and C2C in the whole WeeVerse.&#x20;
* CoComm provides flexible and dynamic business routing and management between all parties involved as a result of negotiation, peer-to-peer service discovery, or service-orienting computing.

## Protocol Overview

* The WeeLink protocol is a Decentralized Business Network construction built on a blockchain and with a native token. Clients spend tokens for deploying, operating, sharing and transacting business activities, Business developers and miners earn tokens by providing developing, computing and verifying services.&#x20;
* The WeeLink handles business requests respectively via three kinds of verifiable markets: the Application Market, the Development Market, and the Hybrid Cloud Market. Clients and miners set the prices for the services requested and offered, and submit their orders to the markets.&#x20;
* The markets are operated by the WeeLink Alliance Network(“WAN”) which employs Proof-of-Authority, Proof-ofWork, Proof-of-Integrity, Proof-of-Asset and Proof-of-Stake to guarantee that developers and miners have correctly completed the developing, computing and verifying services they committed to do.&#x20;
* Finally, miners can participate in the creation of new blocks for the underlying blockchain. The influence of a miner over the next block is proportional to the amount of their computing power currently in use in the network. A sketch of the WeeLink protocol, defined later within the paper, is illustrated in Section 3.
