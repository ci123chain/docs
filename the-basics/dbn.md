  WeeLink is a powerful Decentralized Business Network (DBN) and the name comes
  from the mission we are building for  this network.

# DBN

## Basic

* Though the possible applications of blockchain technology are already mentioned in multiple industries, and one of the most promising seems to be using it as a new type of payment rail, multiple obstacles must be overcome before blockchain can arrive as a mainstream technology. There is widespread belief that blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, is going to change EVERYTHING. And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain–besides currency speculation and transactions.
* Particularly, it may take years to implement a widely used blockchain application system. Both cost and functionality are major concerns. The world today relies on hundreds of billions of dollars of present-day IT infrastructure. Replacing existing systems would require careful planning, a potentially lengthy transition period and more money spent on new or enhanced IT technologies. Blockchain platforms and solutions would have to be configured to integrate with recent infrastructure, and may be evaluated against desired performance metrics for processing time, efficiency and other metrics beyond data security.
* Using a hybrid system rather than a pure bibliolatry on-chain Dapp, WeeLink is positioned to effectively bridge the gap between most popular technologies and blockchain adoption, and significantly reduce the cost. Essentially, the WeeVerse presents a better digital mirror of the physical world than the present-day island-like internet applications. The WeeVerse will be a distributed business infrastructure much like the physical world, supporting direct, complex, effective and many different types of CoComm between businesses. It is also the first realistic model of semantic web of a large scale, facilitating service-oriented computation.

## Components

### Full Nodes (FNs)



A full node is a node that downloads all blocks and transactions to its local storage. More specifically, a full node:

1. Has all blocks and transactions
2. Is a fully independent node on a blockchain network
3. Is able to provide blocks and transactions to other nodes
4. Is able to get new blocks and transactions from other nodes
5. Is able to verify all blocks
6. Full nodes are used on a cryptocurrency network for sending and receiving coins.

### Light Nodes (LNs)



A Light Node is also called Light Client and Lightweight Client. The benefit of a full node is that it downloads all blocks and transactions, so it is an independent node on a blockchain network. The drawback of a full node is that it downloads all blocks and transactions, so it requires a lot of local storage and requires a lot of computing power to verify blocks. Getting all blocks and transactions is unnecessary for people who just want to send or receive coins. They don’t care about old transactions. They don’t care about other people’s transactions. They only care about their own transactions. Therefore, Light Node was invented to save space and computing time. A light node only downloads block headers to validate the authenticity of the transactions. A light node uses a method called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) to verify transactions.More specifically, a light node:

1. Has block headers and some transactions
2. Has a pair of private/public keys
3. Uses SPV to verify transactions A light node does not
4. Connect to a blockchain network directly. A light node relies on a full node to connect to a Blockchain network.
5. Verify all blocks. A light node relies on a full node to verify all blocks. Because a light node is heavily reliant on a full node, the full node can see the transactions and balances of the light node. This drawback can be remedied by connecting your light nodes to your own full node.

### Public Cloud Nodes (PCNs)



* PCNs are available zones (AZs) with full nodes and provide hybrid cloud solutions and services that can help you run and manage your applications wherever they may need to reside. Vorgs could choose Apps and Dapps from the Application Market, run and monitor their on-chain and off-chain applications using the PCNs’ infrastructure, APIs, services, and tools wherever their applications may need to reside to meet low latency, local data processing, or data residency requirements.&#x20;
* As businesses realize the potential of cloud, developing a smart approach to deliver a consistent digital experience and a focus on business outcomes has become a top priority for enterprises. Enterprises can go digital on a strong foundation of cloud, scale effortlessly, introduce innovation into development, be well prepared for a world of multi-cloud and serverless environments, stay agile, adopt new business models, and change the way they compete to maximize business value from digital transformation initiatives. PCNs provide Vogs the convenience and can lower the initial cost of setup, transaction and maintenance of their digital assets on the Hybrid Cloud Market. WeeLink adopted innovative cloud native service mesh-based architecture for PCNs.&#x20;
* An on-node low-code development platform provides a development environment used to create hybrid on-chain and offchain application software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming, and can produce entirely operational applications without additional coding for most situations. The low-code development platforms reduce the amount of traditional hand coding, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications. A common benefit is that a wider range of people can contribute to the application's development—not only those with formal programming skills.
* PCNs also provide formal development Vorgs multi-chain integrated development environments for creating pure or hybrid blockchain applications. It can support a variety of underlying online compilation, chain deployment, contract interaction, and other functions. The on-node Development Market provides developers a marketplace that makes it easy to find and acquire third-party blockchain open-source code, on-chain contracts and off-chain microservice, other companion applications, and plugins.
