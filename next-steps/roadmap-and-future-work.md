# Roadmap and Future Work

## On-going Work

1. The following topics represent ongoing work.&#x20;
2. Raise the Interchain Capablity of the WeeLink Bridge to heterogeneous blockchains.&#x20;
3. Increase the number of application and component in the stores.&#x20;
4. Register Semantic Web related service description.&#x20;
5. Expansion of Virtual WeeVerse Space. 5. More dApi capability.

## Open Questions

There are a number of open questions, in particularly for 1) whether and when we adopt a web assembly VM, and 2) whether and when we should implement a more disruptive structure.

## Proofs and Formal Verification

Because of the clear value of proofs and formal verification, we plan to prove many properties of the WeeLink network and develop formally verified protocol specifications in the coming 1-2 months.
