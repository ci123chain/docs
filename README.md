The internet is in the middle of a revolution from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0. Web 1.0 is a place where we could all meet and read and write. Online service providers were the gateway to Web 1.0, where businesses, individuals and governments began to consume and occasionally post content.

Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0 brought us the "Web as Platform,” where software applications are built on the Web as opposed to on the desktop. This enabled masses of users to participate in content creation on social networks, blogs, sharing sites and more. Search engines and social media platforms driven by user-generated content disrupted the media, advertising and retail industries. Web 2.0’s business model relies on user participation to create fresh content and profile data to be sold to third parties for marketing purposes. Indeed, the internet has become a massive app store, dominated by centralized apps from Google, Facebook and Amazon, where everyone is trying to build an audience, collect data and monetize that data through targeted advertising.

Web 3.0, will bring us a fairer internet by enabling the individual to be a sovereign. True sovereignty implies owning and being able to control who profits from one’s time and information. Web 3.0 will be a semantic web using blockchain technology and service-oriented computing. Web 3.0 is all about changing the way we think about constructing critical business systems.

Web 3.0’s decentralized blockchain protocol will enable individuals to connect to an internet where they can own and be properly compensated for their time and data, eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decentralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars.
